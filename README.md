## WinZone - README

### Description
**WinZone** is an application developed during the Mostar Hackathon in 2023, where a team had 48 hours to create a functional application with the goal of categorizing and displaying achievements and tracking user profiles' progress. This README provides essential information about the project, its purpose, technologies used, and future development plans.

### Purpose
The WinZone application aims to enable users to track and achieve their goals and accomplishments in various areas. The application allows users to log in and register, view achievements, track their progress, and compete for rankings among users.

### Technologies
- **Frontend**: The frontend of the application was developed using React.js. It consists of three main parts:
  - **Ranking Section**: Displays user rankings based on their achievements.
  - **Login and Register Section**: Allows users to sign in and register on the platform.
  - **Achievements Section**: Displays available tasks, achievements, and user profiles.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for the backend and database. With Firebase, user data, achievements, and progress are securely stored and updated. It's worth noting that during the Hackathon, we initially used .Net for the backend and MySQL for database management, but I later transitioned to using Firebase for enhanced functionality.

### Future Development
Future plans for the WinZone application include:
- Additional user features such as setting personalized goals and receiving notifications for achieved accomplishments.
- Improved user interface and performance optimization.
- Integration with social media platforms to enable sharing achievements and competing with friends.
- Ongoing updates and maintenance to ensure functionality and security.
